to investigate the behavior of decomposition and combustion
of 50% H

in an open chamber. The fuel is stored in a
tank which is pressurized to 10 bar gauge using a nitrogen
cylinder. A solenoid valve (S1) is used to control inlet
flow of the fuel mixture into the chamber through a full
cone spray injector. This injector provides for a uniform
distribution of fuel mixture on the catalyst bed made up
of MnO
2
particles (mean diameter: 3mm). The thickness of
the catalyst bed is approximately 35 mm. Two glowplugs
are provided to maintain a high temperature (600-700K)
within the catalyst bed. Another glowplug is located before
the the catalyst bed to heat up the gases. These glowplugs
are powered by 12V DC power supply. Two pressure transducers (model ADZ SML10.0) P
c
and P
e
are mounted on
the combustion chamber, and exhaust line, respectively, to
monitor the variation of pressures with time. These pressure
transducers are powered by a 24V DC power supply, and

filled with a silicon based oil to prevent the direct contact
of high temperature gases with the piezo-electric sensors.
Data is acquired through a Labjack H3-UV data acquisition
system at the rate of 1000 Hz. Two uni-directional valves,
V1 and V2, are used for safety purposes. Figure. 2 shows a
photographic representation of the experimental setup.
Prior to the first injection, the glowplugs are powered on
for 3 minutes to heat the catalyst bed and internal environment of chamber to a uniform temperature. The power to
the glow plugs is switched at 1/60 Hz with 50% on time at
this stage. This switching allows the entire bed to achieve
a uniform initial temperature. While the decomposition of
H
2
O
2
may proceed without the glowplugs within the catalyst
bed [6], it is strongly temperature-dependent, and the decomposition rate increases with temperature. Thus, the glowplugs
within the catalyst bed ensure a rapid decomposition of
H
2
O
2
. After the first injection, the glow plugs are kept on
continuously.
Upon injection, the fuel mixture impinges on a heated
catalyst bed. When H
2
O
2
comes in contact with the MnO
2
particles, it decomposes into steam and reactive oxygen [6].
In the present setup, these hot gases are allowed to exhaust
through an orifice plate to the atmosphere. Kindly note
that the present work focuses only on modeling of the
decomposition of 50% H
2
O
2
over the MnO
2
bed.
